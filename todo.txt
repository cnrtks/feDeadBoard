 really inconsitent use of jquery and vanilla js try to determine where and when to use what
    - document.getelemnt/class vs $(.)
    - forEach vs .each
    -gsap.set(kjask{attr}) vs $().attr("asdsa", "asdsa") vs .setAttributeNS


fix connector line

morphology is very laggy, truncate values????

!!!
nextEnum should be replace with a function that gets the indexOf the current blah blah
you shoudl remove this.controllerspecificindex and rename the arrays,
!!!

look into why compoite (and maybe others) are double clicking

 cleaan up query selectors (consistent passing of elements vs classes into drag and such)
the drag functions need to be simplified and unified and something
lower default inrertia velocity
standardize attrKnobs and relevant functions
keyword super and this are inconsitently used for parent functions
class/id inconsistency in source svgs
colorize lighting elements and color selector
lse's need to anchor to the light socket

overlapping elements hit test fix it

spot light functionlity
poit light xyz controls
k1k2k3k4 for the arithmetic composite operator
blend controller needs some visual indication that mode is changeing
colorMatrix/componentTransfer needs some visual indication that type is changing

nextMode/nextOperator/change operator can all be simplified into one function? maybe

move filter defs to canvas OR move everything to one svg and have grid squares overlaping with skull invalid for controllers
fix dropintoSocket and move into FilterElementClass

default values for everything need to be set including default colors for color picker inputs
theres some values initialized in createController of some class(es) move them to initVars function

change all string manipulation to string interpolation rather than string concat


 the filters

NOIN            <li id="liMerge" class="liFe">Merge</li>
in mergeNode
in            <li id="liConvolutionMatrix" class="liFe">Convolve</li>
in                        <li id="liTile" class="liFe">Tile</li>???????????????????????????
